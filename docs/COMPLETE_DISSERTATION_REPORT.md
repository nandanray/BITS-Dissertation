The system architecture comprises three main layers:

1. **Edge Device Layer**: Physical hardware and operating system
2. **Container Runtime Layer**: Docker and containerd for containerization
3. **Kubernetes Orchestration Layer**: K3d/K3s for cluster management

```

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

#### 3.1.1 Development Environment
The development environment setup ensures consistent tooling across development machines. This includes installing essential tools such as Docker, kubectl, k3d, and Helm.

```bash
# Key components installation
apt-get install -y curl wget git build-essential
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```

**Detailed Component Analysis:**

1. **Core Utilities**
   - `curl`: Primary tool for downloading components and interacting with APIs
   - `wget`: Used for reliable large file downloads with resume capability
   - `git`: Version control for configuration and application code
   - `build-essential`: Compilation tools for native dependencies

2. **Docker Installation**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   ```
   The Docker installation process:
   - Verifies system compatibility
   - Installs required dependencies
   - Configures system settings
   - Sets up container runtime

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Group permissions management
   - System resource access
   - Network configuration
   - Container isolation

#### 3.1.2 Kubernetes Cluster
The Kubernetes setup forms the foundation of our edge computing platform. The cluster is created using k3d, a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher's minimal Kubernetes distribution) in Docker.

```yaml
cluster_spec:
  name: wasm-edge-cluster
  version: v1.26.7-k3s1
  resources:
    control_plane:
      memory: "1024Mi"
      cpu: "1"
    worker_nodes:
      memory: "1024Mi"
      cpu: "1"
      count: 1
```

**Architectural Decisions:**

1. **Control Plane Components**
   - API Server: Central management point
   - Controller Manager: State management
   - Scheduler: Pod placement
   - etcd: Configuration storage

2. **Worker Node Configuration**
   - Resource limits for predictable performance
   - Network policy implementation
   - Storage configuration
   - Security settings

#### 3.1.3 Monitoring Dashboard
The monitoring dashboard provides real-time insights into cluster and application performance. It is implemented using Streamlit and the Kubernetes Python client.

```python
# Key monitoring components
class ClusterMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api = client.CoreV1Api()
        self.metrics = client.CustomObjectsApi()
```

**Monitoring Features:**
1. Resource utilization tracking
2. Performance metrics collection
3. Error detection and reporting
4. Health status monitoring

### 3.2 Phase 2: Runtime Environment

#### 3.2.1 WebAssembly Integration
The WebAssembly runtime environment enables efficient execution of WebAssembly modules. This phase involves setting up Wasmtime and WasmEdge runtimes, along with the necessary SDKs and tools.

```yaml
# Runtime Components
runtimes:
  - name: Wasmtime
    version: "30.0.2"
    features: ["WASI", "JIT"]
  
  - name: WasmEdge
    version: "0.11.2"
    features: ["Networking", "TensorFlow"]

sdk:
  name: "WASI SDK"
  version: "14"
  
tools:
  name: "WABT"
  version: "1.0.29"
```

#### 3.2.2 Resource Management
Resource management ensures efficient allocation and utilization of resources. This includes setting memory and CPU limits for WebAssembly functions.

```yaml
resource_controls:
  memory:
    limits: "512Mi"
    requests: "256Mi"
  cpu:
    limits: "500m"
    requests: "200m"
```

### 3.3 Phase 3: Kubernetes Integration

#### 3.3.1 Custom Resources
Custom resources extend Kubernetes API to manage WebAssembly workloads. This includes defining Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for WasmFunction and WasmRuntime.

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.bits-dissertation.io/v1alpha1
kind: WasmFunction
spec:
  runtime: wasmedge
  source: function.wasm
  resources:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
```

#### 3.3.2 Operator Framework
The operator framework automates the deployment and management of WebAssembly functions. This includes developing custom controllers to handle the lifecycle of WasmFunction resources.

```python
class FunctionController:
    def reconcile(self):
        """
        Main reconciliation loop
        1. State observation
        2. Desired state comparison
        3. Action execution
        4. Status update
        """
```

## 4. Analysis and Results

### 4.1 Performance Metrics
The performance metrics provide insights into the efficiency of the platform. This includes measuring startup time, resource usage, and function latency.

```yaml
performance_results:
  startup_time:
    cold_start: 
      mean: "450ms"
      p95: "600ms"
    warm_start:
      mean: "50ms"
      p95: "75ms"
  resource_usage:
    memory:
      baseline: "45MB"
      per_function: "5MB"
    cpu:
      idle: "5%"
      peak: "80%"
```

### 4.2 Security Analysis
The security analysis ensures the platform meets the required security standards. This includes implementing sandboxed execution environments, resource isolation, network policy enforcement, and RBAC.

- Sandboxed execution environment
- Resource isolation
- Network policy enforcement
- RBAC implementation
