## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 System Architecture

The architecture is composed of three distinct layers, each ensuring robust operation across the entire platform.

1. **Edge Device Layer:**  
   - Represents the physical hardware and underlying operating system.
   - Responsible for executing containerized applications.
  
2. **Container Runtime Layer:**  
   - Utilizes Docker or containerd to encapsulate and isolate applications.
   - Ensures that applications run reproducibly across different devices.
   
3. **Kubernetes Orchestration Layer:**  
   - Manages container deployment, scaling, and networking via lightweight clusters (e.g., k3d/K3s).
   - Provides a unified control plane for deploying microservices and operator frameworks.

----------------------------------------

## 3. Technical Implementation

This section documents commands, scripts, YAML configurations, and code implementations with detailed explanations.

### 3.1 Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

#### 3.1.1 Development Environment
  
*Command Explanations:*
- `apt-get install -y curl wget git build-essential`  
  Installs basic system utilities crucial for subsequent installations.
- `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh`  
  Downloads the Docker installer script with error handling.
- `curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"`  
  Retrieves the latest stable release of the Kubernetes CLI tool.

*In-depth Explanation:*  
This setup script ensures that all prerequisites for container development are installed. Tools like curl and wget are critical for fetching resources from the network, while git manages version-controlled code. build-essential provides necessary compilers and libraries. Docker will allow container image building and execution. The kubectl CLI is essential for interfacing with the Kubernetes API.

*Security Insights:*  
Proper configuration (e.g., managing group permissions for Docker) improves security by isolating container operations from the host OS.
----------------------------------------

#### 3.1.2 Kubernetes Cluster
  
*YAML Explanation:*  
The following configuration defines a lightweight Kubernetes cluster:
```yaml
cluster_spec:
  name: wasm-edge-cluster
  version: v1.26.7-k3s1
  resources:
    control_plane:
      memory: "1024Mi"
      cpu: "1"
    worker_nodes:
      memory: "1024Mi"
      cpu: "1"
      count: 1
```
- **name:** Sets the cluster name.
- **version:** Specifies k3s version ensuring compatibility.
- **resources:** Defines memory and CPU allocation for control plane and agent nodes.

*Command Explanation:*  
The `k3d cluster create` command uses these settings to provision a cluster that is resource efficient, making it suitable for edge scenarios where hardware resources are limited.

*Additional Commentary:*  
Using k3d allows fast operations while keeping the cluster footprint small. The YAML configuration ensures that resources are not over-allocated, preventing performance degradation and ensuring predictable behavior.
----------------------------------------

#### 3.1.3 Monitoring Dashboard
  
The monitoring dashboard is implemented using a Python script (with Streamlit) to visualize cluster data.

*Key Code Details:*
```python
# Example snippet to initialize the Kubernetes API client
class ClusterMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api = client.CoreV1Api()
        self.metrics = client.CustomObjectsApi()
```
*Explanation:*  
- `client.CoreV1Api()`: Interacts with the core Kubernetes API to retrieve information about nodes, pods, and services.
- `client.CustomObjectsApi()`: Used to fetch custom metrics if the Metrics Server is installed.

The dashboard displays cluster nodes, pods, and service information in neatly formatted tables using Pandas. Exception handling ensures reliable operation even when the cluster's API faces errors.
----------------------------------------

### 3.2 Phase 2: Runtime Environment

#### 3.2.1 WebAssembly Integration
  
*YAML Explanation:*
```yaml
runtimes:
  - name: Wasmtime
    version: "30.0.2"
    features: ["WASI", "JIT"]
  - name: WasmEdge
    version: "0.11.2"
    features: ["Networking", "TensorFlow"]
sdk:
  name: "WASI SDK"
  version: "14"
tools:
  name: "WABT"
  version: "1.0.29"
```
- **Wasmtime:** Utilizes the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) and Just-In-Time compilation.
- **WasmEdge:** Designed for cloud native operations with features like enhanced networking and AI capabilities.
- **WASI SDK** and **WABT**: Provide development tools for compiling and debugging WASM modules.

*Command Explanations:*  
The installation scripts download and install these tools while updating PATH variables, ensuring that version checks succeed.
----------------------------------------

#### 3.2.2 Resource Management
  
*YAML Explanation:*
```yaml
resource_controls:
  memory:
    limits: "512Mi"
    requests: "256Mi"
  cpu:
    limits: "500m"
    requests: "200m"
```
- **Memory & CPU Limits:**  
  Ensure that each WASM function is allocated a defined slice of system resources, preventing runaway consumption and ensuring fairness.

*Additional Commentary:*  
Regular monitoring of these resource metrics helps in adjusting the settings to better match workload demands.
----------------------------------------

### 3.3 Phase 3: Kubernetes Integration

#### 3.3.1 Custom Resources
  
*YAML Explanation:*
```yaml
apiVersion: operators.bits-dissertation.io/v1alpha1
kind: WasmFunction
metadata:
  name: example-function
spec:
  runtime: wasmedge
  source: function.wasm
  resources:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
```
- **CRDs:**  
  Extend Kubernetes to manage WebAssembly functions with defined runtime, source, and resource settings.

*Extended Details:*  
Operators use these definitions to dynamically adjust, create, or delete WASM functions, thereby automating deployment.
----------------------------------------

#### 3.3.2 Operator Framework
  
*Code Explanation:*  
Below is a skeleton snippet defining the operator’s reconciliation logic:
```python
class FunctionController:
    def reconcile(self):
        """
        Reconcile loop:
        1. Fetch current state of the WasmFunction.
        2. Determine desired state from configuration.
        3. Compare states and calculate the required changes.
        4. Update the resource and confirm deployment status.
        """
        try:
            function = self.k8s_client.get_wasm_function(event.name, event.namespace)
            desired_state = self.calculate_desired_state(function)
            current_state = self.get_current_state(function)
            self.apply_changes(desired_state, current_state)
            self.update_status(function, "Deployed")
        except Exception as e:
            self.update_status(function, f"Error: {e}")
```
*Detailed Commentary:*  
The operator continuously monitors custom resource changes. Discrepancies between the current and desired state trigger corrective actions, ensuring system convergence.
----------------------------------------

## 4. Analysis and Results

### 4.1 Performance Metrics
  
*YAML Explanation:*
```yaml
performance_benchmarks:
  startup_time:
    cold_start:
      mean: "450ms"
      p95: "600ms"
    warm_start:
      mean: "50ms"
      p95: "75ms"
  resource_usage:
    memory:
      baseline: "45MB"
      per_function: "5MB"
    cpu:
      idle: "5%"
      peak: "80%"
  function_latency:
    p50: "20ms"
    p95: "50ms"
    p99: "100ms"
```
- **Startup Times:**  
  Differentiate between cold and warm starts.
- **Resource Usage:**  
  Baseline and per-instance resource consumption.
- **Function Latency:**  
  Response time distribution through percentile values.

*Monitoring these metrics informs configuration and scaling decisions.*
----------------------------------------

### 4.2 Security Analysis
  
*Key Measures:*
- **Sandboxed Execution:**  
  Each WASM module runs isolated, reducing host risk.
- **Resource Isolation:**  
  Prevents conflicts between concurrently running modules.
- **Network Policy Enforcement:**  
  Defines which pods and services can communicate.
- **RBAC:**  
  Implements least-privilege access controls.

*Extended Explanation:*  
Security is built into every system layer, from container isolation through network policies and RBAC to the sandboxed execution of WASM modules, these measures collectively minimize risk.
----------------------------------------

## 5. Future Work

*Roadmap Commentary:*  
Further improvements will include integration with IoT devices and serverless edge functions.
----------------------------------------

### 5.2 Research Directions
